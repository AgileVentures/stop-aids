# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# require 'CSV'

# CSV.foreach('candidates.csv') do |row|
#   Candidate.create(
#     constituency_id: row[0], 
#     name: row[5], 
#     party_id: row[2],
#     twitter: row[6])
# end
